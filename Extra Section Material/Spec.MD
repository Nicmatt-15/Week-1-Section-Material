## Program Overview

In this assignment, you will draw 3 stairs of different sizes. This assessment goal is to test you underestanding about:

1. Creating method to separate different parts of a program
2. Creating method to reduce redundancy
3. Creating a chain of method call
4. Creating a figure using the backslash character (an escape character)
5. Creating a good documentation of a basic code

## Program Structure and Design (SD)

---

Your program should fulfill the following criteria:

1. It should have **exactly** 4 methods.
2. It should only have **exactly** 1 blank println. `System.out.println();`
3. It should have **exactly** 6 non-blank println. `System.out.println(...);`
4. Main method should have **exactly** 4 lines of code. All 4 lines should be method calls.
5. You **should not** have any method with only 1 line of code. These are considered trivial methods.

## Program Use of Language Features (UoLF)

---

Your program should fulfill the following criteria:

1. It should not contain any `\n` character
2. All blank line should be printed using `System.out.println();` _**not**_ `System.out.println("");`

## Program Document and Readability (DR)

---

Your program should fulfill the following criteria:

1. It should have an approrpriate header and class comment
2. Every method should have a method comment right before the
   method declaration line
3. The closing curly bracket of one method should be followed
   by a single blank line before the next method comment
4. The code should be indented properly
5. Method name should be descriptive
6. Method name should be _camelCased_
7. Class name should be _PascalCased_
8. Any lines that exceeds 100 characters should be broken into
   multiple lines

## Starter Code

---

```java
public class Stairs {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // TODO: Delete this line and write any method call below
        // this line, inside the method call
    }

    // TODO: Delete this line and define additional methods below
}
```
