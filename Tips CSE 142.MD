# Tips For CSE 142

Here are the tips that worked for me and a lot of students:

- Ditch the notes. You have to force yourself to remember the syntax! If you don't remember, try peeking at the provided cheat sheets.
- Remembering syntax and getting used to programming is mostly muscle memory. Because of this, you should practice **a lot**. I find that doing all lab and section problems is the sweet spot.
- Reach out to me through my email (nicmatt@uw.edu) a lot! Don't be afraid to bother me. One of my biggest role as a TA is to help you and hopefully makes you enjoy coding along the way.
  > I am also generally very fast in responding email. My response time is around 10 minutes - 2 hours depending on my schedule.
- Make every resubmission count. Remember, an S is much closer to an E (gradewise) than an N to an S. This means that you should prioritize getting everything to S whenever possible.
- Don't submit incomplete codes. As for extension if you are backed up! This way, you can get a valuable feedback and have a bigger chance of getting all Es in your resubmission.
- CSE 142 grading isn't always the nicest. Be aware of how you are doing every week. This prevents any nasty surprise at the end of the quarter!
- Try to enjoy what you are doing in this class so that you don't get burn out very quickly.
- Communication is key! Trust me, you will get a lot if you ask me a lot of questions!
- Find resources that works for you. Not every resource in this course suits everyone. Choose the one that you find personally useful.
- Learn keyboard shortcuts and copy-pasting! This speeds up your coding
  a lot!
- **MOST IMPOTANT: Don't cave into peer pressure. There may be some students with prior programming experience that boast their programming skill around. Try your best to block these voices out and focus on making yourself better at coding!**
